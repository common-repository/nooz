<h3 id="press-release-options">Press Release Options</h3>
<p>The Press Release tab contains options to modify the behavior of a press release page.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>URL</strong></p>
        <p>By default press releases will be published with the following permalink <code>/news/press-releases/{{slug}}</code> structure. Take care when changing this option as it will affect page links. Your <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Optimization#Caching" target="_blank">cache</a> may need to be cleared when changing this option.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Featured Image</strong></p>
        <p>This is the default featured image that will appear if one is not added for a press release.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Location</strong></p>
        <p>The location precedes the press release and helps to orient the reader (e.g. San Francisco, CA).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Date Format</strong></p>
        <p>The date follows the location. Leave this blank to use the default date format as set in WordPress. Learn more about <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Formatting_Date_and_Time" target="_blank">formatting dates</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Dateline Format</strong></p>
        <p>The dateline precedes the press release content and is usually a combination of the location and date followed by a long-dash.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Boilerplate</strong></p>
        <p>The boilerplate is a few sentences at the end of your press release that describes your organization. This should be used consistently on press materials and written strategically, to properly reflect your organization. Using HTML in this field is allowed. This option helps keep your press release content separate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Ending</strong></p>
        <p>The ending mark signifies the absolute end of the press release (e.g. ###, END, XXX, -30-). Removing this value will disable this option.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Media Contact</strong></p>
        <p>The media contact is the person or organization that can be contacted for more information about the press release.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
